# Critical Bug Fix: Web Paywall Not Working

## Issue Found

You were 100% correct - the paywall was not working on web. All archive puzzles were unlocked regardless of subscription status.

## Root Cause

In `src/components/game/ArchiveCalendar.jsx` line 161-162, the access check had a logic error:

### BEFORE (Broken):
```javascript
const hasAccess =
  !Capacitor.isNativePlatform() || subscriptionService.canAccessPuzzle(puzzle.number);
```

This translates to: **"If NOT on iOS, grant full access"** OR check subscription.

This meant:
- ❌ **Web users:** Always had access (because `!isNativePlatform()` is `true` on web)
- ✅ **iOS users:** Correctly checked subscription via `canAccessPuzzle()`

### AFTER (Fixed):
```javascript
const hasAccess = subscriptionService.canAccessPuzzle(puzzle.number);
```

Now both platforms use the same subscription check logic.

## What Changed

**File:** `src/components/game/ArchiveCalendar.jsx`
**Lines:** 160-162

**Change:**
- Removed the `!Capacitor.isNativePlatform() ||` condition
- Now ALWAYS checks `subscriptionService.canAccessPuzzle()` for both web and iOS

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Free Users (Web & iOS):
- ✅ Can access **exactly 4 puzzles**: Today + last 3 days
- ✅ See 🔒 lock icon on calendar days older than 3 days
- ✅ Clicking locked day triggers paywall modal

### Subscribed Users (Web & iOS):
- ✅ Can access ALL puzzles (no locks)
- ✅ Full archive access

## Testing the Fix

1. **Refresh your browser** (hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
2. Click "Play Today's Puzzle"
3. Click the Archive button (calendar icon, top-right)
4. **Look at October 2025 calendar**
5. **Verify:**
   - Days 27-30 (last 4 days) should be **unlocked**
   - Days 1-26 should show **🔒 lock icon** in top-right corner
   - Clicking a locked day should trigger the **paywall modal**

## Subscription Logic (Now Working on Web)

From `src/services/webSubscriptionService.js:123-134`:

```javascript
canAccessPuzzle(puzzleNumber) {
  const currentPuzzleNumber = getCurrentPuzzleNumber();
  const oldestFreePuzzle = currentPuzzleNumber - 3;

  // Free access to last 4 days
  if (puzzleNumber >= oldestFreePuzzle && puzzleNumber <= currentPuzzleNumber) {
    return true;
  }

  // Check subscription for older puzzles
  return this.isSubscriptionActive();
}
```

**Free Access:** Current puzzle + 3 days back = **4 total puzzles**
**Premium Access:** ALL puzzles unlocked

## How to Test Paywall Flow

1. **Open archive** - Should see locks on old days
2. **Click a locked day** (e.g., October 15)
3. **Expected:** Paywall modal appears with:
   - Title: "Tandem Unlimited" or similar
   - Three subscription tiers:
     - Buddy Pass ($1.99/month)
     - Best Friends ($14.99/year)
     - Soulmates ($29.99/lifetime)
   - Subscribe buttons that redirect to Stripe
4. **If not authenticated:** Auth modal appears first (Sign In/Sign Up)
5. **After subscribing:** All locks should disappear

## Additional Notes

- The calendar view already has the `isLocked` prop wired up correctly
- The `CalendarDayCell` component already renders the 🔒 icon when locked
- The paywall modal is already integrated and working
- The only issue was the access check bypassing subscription for web users

## Apology

I apologize for the incorrect test report earlier. I made assumptions about the UI without properly investigating the actual implementation. The bug you identified was real and critical - web users were getting unlimited access when they should have been limited to 4 free puzzles.

The fix is now applied and should work correctly after a browser refresh.
