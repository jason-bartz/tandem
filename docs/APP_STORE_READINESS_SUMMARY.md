## üî¥ CRITICAL - Must Complete Before Submission

### 1. CloudKit Dashboard Setup (Est. 30-45 min)

**PRIORITY: HIGHEST - App will be rejected without this**

Steps:

1. Go to [CloudKit Dashboard](https://icloud.developer.apple.com/dashboard/)
2. Sign in with Apple Developer account
3. Select container: `iCloud.com.tandemdaily.app`
4. Create record types (see [docs/CLOUDKIT_QUICKSTART.md](./CLOUDKIT_QUICKSTART.md)):
   - UserStats
   - PuzzleResult
   - PuzzleProgress
   - UserPreferences
5. Configure indexes for each record type
6. **CRITICAL**: Deploy schema to Production environment
7. Test on physical device with production CloudKit

**Why this is critical**: Without CloudKit schema in Production, iCloud sync will fail for all App Store users, causing immediate rejection.

### 2. App Store Screenshots (Est. 1-2 hours)

**PRIORITY: HIGH - Cannot submit without screenshots**

Required sizes:

- **6.7" iPhone** (1290 x 2796): 5-10 screenshots
- **iPad Pro** (2048 x 2732): 5-10 screenshots (if supporting iPad)

Suggested screenshots:

1. Main game screen with active puzzle
2. Dark mode showcase
3. Statistics/streaks screen
4. Archive/calendar view
5. Completion celebration

**How to capture**:

```bash
# Run on device/simulator
npm run ios:dev

# In simulator: Cmd+S to save screenshot
# Save to computer, resize if needed
# Upload to App Store Connect
```

### 3. Xcode Project Verification (Est. 15 min)

**Before archiving**, verify in Xcode:

1. Open `ios/App/App.xcworkspace`
2. Select "App" target ‚Üí "Signing & Capabilities"
3. Confirm:
   - iCloud capability enabled
   - CloudKit checked
   - Container `iCloud.com.tandemdaily.app` selected
   - Background Modes ‚Üí Remote notifications checked
4. Build Settings ‚Üí Code Signing Entitlements = `Tandem.entitlements`
5. No build errors or critical warnings

---

## üü° HIGH PRIORITY - Should Complete

### 4. Console Log Cleanup (Est. 1-2 hours)

**Issue**: 217 console.log statements across 43 files

**Impact**: Performance overhead, potential information leaks

**Solution**: Either:

- Option A: Remove all console.log statements
- Option B: Use existing logger (`src/lib/logger.js`) which auto-disables in production
- Option C: Wrap in `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development')`

**Quick fix for critical files**:

```javascript
// Replace console.log with logger
import logger from '@/lib/logger';
logger.debug('Message'); // Only shows in development
```

### 5. TestFlight Beta Testing (Est. 1 week)

**Highly recommended before public release**:

1. Archive build in Xcode
2. Upload to App Store Connect
3. Add yourself as internal tester
4. Install via TestFlight
5. Test all features on real device
6. Invite 5-10 external testers
7. Collect feedback
8. Fix any issues
9. Upload final build
