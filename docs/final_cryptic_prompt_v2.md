# DAILY CRYPTIC PUZZLE GENERATOR PROMPT

## YOUR TASK:
Create ONE cryptic crossword clue where **EXACTLY 2 emojis replace visible words** in an otherwise normal cryptic clue.

## THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE: EMOJI REPLACEMENT TEST

**Before submitting your clue, perform this test:**

1. Write your clue WITH emojis: "Moods 🔀 for gloomy fates (5)"
2. Replace each emoji with [BLANK]: "Moods [BLANK] for gloomy fates (5)"
3. **If the clue has gaps/blanks, you did it correctly! ✓**
4. **If the clue still makes sense without emojis, you FAILED ❌**

### ✅ CORRECT Example (emojis replace words):
- **With emojis:** "Moods 🔀 for gloomy fates (5)"
- **Test removal:** "Moods ____ for gloomy fates (5)"
- **Result:** GAP! The emoji was replacing "disrupted" ✓

### ❌ WRONG Example (emojis are decorative):
- **With emojis:** "💬🔥 Moods disrupted for gloomy fates (5)"
- **Test removal:** "Moods disrupted for gloomy fates (5)"
- **Result:** NO GAP! Still works! The emojis were decoration ❌

## EXACTLY 2 EMOJIS REQUIRED

⚠️ **MANDATORY:** Every clue must have **EXACTLY 2 emojis**.

Your 2 emojis can be used in two ways:

### OPTION A: Both emojis work together as ONE word
- Example: "🐝🦂 gets Ray wandering (8)"
  - 🐝🦂 (bee + scorpion) = "STING"
  - Without emojis: "_____ gets Ray wandering" (has gap!) ✓
  - Answer: STRAYING (STING contains RAY)

### OPTION B: Each emoji represents a DIFFERENT word
- Example: "Parties 🔀 for 🏴‍☠️ (7)"
  - 🔀 = "scrambled" (the indicator)
  - 🏴‍☠️ = "sea raiders" (the definition)
  - Without emojis: "Parties _____ for _____ (7)" (has gaps!) ✓
  - Answer: PIRATES (PARTIES scrambled)

---

## STEP-BY-STEP CONSTRUCTION:

### STEP 1: Build a complete cryptic clue (NO EMOJIS YET)

Start with a valid cryptic clue using only text:
- "Scrambled parties for sea raiders (7)" = PIRATES
- "Moods disrupted for gloomy fates (5)" = DOOMS
- "Sting gets Ray wandering (8)" = STRAYING

Verify the cryptic mechanics work perfectly!

### STEP 2: Identify 2 words to replace with emojis

Pick exactly 2 words from your clue to replace:

**Example 1:** "Scrambled parties for sea raiders (7)"
- Replace "scrambled" → 🔀
- Replace "sea raiders" → 🏴‍☠️
- **Result:** "🔀 parties for 🏴‍☠️ (7)"

**Example 2:** "Moods disrupted for gloomy fates (5)"
- Replace "moods" → 💬🔥 (2 emojis for 1 word)
- **Result:** "💬🔥 disrupted for gloomy fates (5)"

**Example 3:** "Sting gets Ray wandering (8)"
- Replace "sting" → 🐝🦂 (2 emojis for 1 word)
- **Result:** "🐝🦂 gets Ray wandering (8)"

### STEP 3: VERIFY with the replacement test

Remove your emojis. Does the clue have obvious gaps?
- ✅ YES = You did it correctly!
- ❌ NO = You failed. Emojis are decorative. Start over.

## COMPLETE WORKING EXAMPLES:

### ANAGRAM Example 1:
**Clue:** "🔀 parties for 🏴‍☠️ (7)"
- Device: Anagram
- 🔀 = "scrambled" (indicator - REPLACED TEXT)
- "parties" = fodder (text)
- 🏴‍☠️ = "sea raiders" (definition - REPLACED TEXT)
- Mechanics: PARTIES scrambled = PIRATES
- **Replacement test:** "_____ parties for _____ (7)" → HAS GAPS ✓

### ANAGRAM Example 2:
**Clue:** "💬🔥 disrupted for gloomy fates (5)"
- Device: Anagram
- 💬🔥 = "moods" (fodder - REPLACED TEXT with 2 emojis)
- "disrupted" = indicator (text)
- "gloomy fates" = definition (text)
- Mechanics: MOODS disrupted = DOOMS
- **Replacement test:** "_____ disrupted for gloomy fates (5)" → HAS GAP ✓

### CONTAINER Example:
**Clue:** "🐝🦂 gets Ray wandering (8)"
- Device: Container
- 🐝🦂 = "sting" (outer word - REPLACED TEXT with 2 emojis)
- "gets" = contains (indicator - text)
- "Ray" = inner word (text)
- "wandering" = definition (text)
- Mechanics: ST(RAY)ING = STRAYING
- **Replacement test:** "_____ gets Ray wandering (8)" → HAS GAP ✓

### REVERSAL Example:
**Clue:** "🛑 🔄 in pans (4)"
- Device: Reversal
- 🛑 = "stop" (fodder - REPLACED TEXT)

- "pans" = definition (text)
- Mechanics: STOP reversed = POTS
- **Replacement test:** "_____ _____ in pans (4)" → HAS GAPS ✓

### CHARADE Example:
**Clue:** "🌊 with shore is beach (8)"
- Device: Charade
- 🌊 = "sea" (first part - REPLACED TEXT)
- "with shore" = second part (text)
- "beach" = definition (text)
- Mechanics: SEA + SHORE = SEASHORE
- **Replacement test:** "_____ with shore is beach (8)" → HAS GAP ✓

## COMMON MISTAKES:

### ❌ MISTAKE #1: Emojis are thematic decoration
**BAD:** "😺🐾 Animal caretaker with zoo permit (9)"
- Test: "Animal caretaker with zoo permit (9)" - NO GAPS!
- The clue works without emojis = DECORATIVE = WRONG

**GOOD:** "🐾🔐 caretaker with permit (9)"
- 🐾🔐 = "zoo animal" (replaces those words)
- Test: "_____ caretaker with permit (9)" - HAS GAP!

### ❌ MISTAKE #2: Using more than 2 emojis
**BAD:** "🔀 💬🔥 for 😔 fates (5)" = 4 emojis total
**GOOD:** "💬🔥 disrupted for gloomy fates (5)" = 2 emojis

### ❌ MISTAKE #3: Emojis paired with redundant text
**BAD:** "🎉🥳 Parties scrambled for pirates (7)"
- "Parties" is written out AND represented by emojis = redundant

**GOOD:** "🎉🥳 scrambled for pirates (7)"
- Emojis REPLACE the word "parties"
