# FINAL CRYPTIC CROSSWORD PROMPT (For ai_services.js)

## YOUR TASK:
Create ONE cryptic crossword clue with **EXACTLY 2 EMOJIS** that replace actual words in the clue.

## MANDATORY REQUIREMENT: EXACTLY 2 EMOJIS
⚠️ **CRITICAL:** Every clue must have **EXACTLY 2 emojis**. No more, no less.
- ❌ 1 emoji: "Master performer 🍳 into watercourse" (NOT ALLOWED)
- ✅ 2 emojis: "Master performer 🍳 into 🌊 (6)" (CORRECT)
- ❌ 3 emojis: "🎪🏃 🍳 into 🌊 (6)" (NOT ALLOWED)

This is the signature mechanic of Daily Cryptic - always exactly 2 emojis.

## CRITICAL INNOVATION - EMOJIS ARE NOT DECORATIVE:
❌ **WRONG:** "🎪🏃 Master performer scrambled into watercourse"
- Problem: Emojis are just thematic decoration (circus/running themes)
- The actual clue components are all text

✅ **CORRECT:** "Master performer 🍳 into 🌊 (6)"
- 🍳 = SCRAMBLED (the anagram indicator)
- 🌊 = STREAM (the definition)
- Emojis ARE functional words in the clue
- Exactly 2 emojis ✓

## THE EMOJI RULES:
1. **Exactly 2 emojis per clue** (enforced strictly)
2. **Emojis must REPLACE words, not decorate them**

You can use emojis to represent:
- **Fodder words** - the word being manipulated (e.g., 🎉 = PARTY, 🎪 = CIRCUS)
- **Indicator words** - cryptic signals (e.g., 🍳 = SCRAMBLED, 🔄 = REVERSED)
- **Definition words** - the answer meaning (e.g., 🌊 = STREAM, 🏴‍☠️ = PIRATE)
- **Connector words** - structure words (e.g., ➕ = AND/WITH)

**Note:** You can use 2 emojis together to represent ONE word (like 🎪🏃 = MASTER), OR use them separately for different words (like 🍳 = SCRAMBLED and 🌊 = STREAM). Either way, total emoji count = 2.

## STRUCTURE EXAMPLES BY DEVICE (all with exactly 2 emojis):
- **Anagram (paired emojis):** "Scrambled 🎉🥳 for sea raiders (7)" = PIRATES
  - 🎉🥳 = PARTIES (fodder - anagrams to PIRATES)
  - Only 2 emojis total ✓

- **Anagram (separate emojis):** "Reformed 🃏🎲 in classroom (7)" = TEACHER
  - 🃏🎲 = CHEATER (fodder - anagrams to TEACHER)
  - Only 2 emojis total ✓

- **Charade:** "🌊 with shore is 🏖️ (8)" = SEASHORE
  - 🌊 = SEA (first part)
  - 🏖️ = BEACH/SEASHORE (definition)

- **Container:** "🐝🦂 gets Ray wandering (8)" = STRAYING
  - 🐝🦂 = STING (outer word that wraps around RAY)
  - Note: Only 2 emojis total ✓

- **Reversal:** "🛑 🔄 in pans (4)" = POTS
  - 🛑 = STOP (reversed to POTS)
  - 🔄 = REVERSED (indicator)

---

## STEP-BY-STEP CONSTRUCTION:

### STEP 1: Choose your cryptic device
Pick from: **anagram**, **charade**, **container**, **deletion**, **reversal**, **homophone**, **double definition**

### STEP 2: Choose a common answer (3-8 letters)
Example: **STREAM** (6 letters)

### STEP 3: Design the cryptic mechanism
For PIRATES (anagram device):
- Answer: PIRATES (7 letters)
- Fodder word that anagrams: PARTIES (same 7 letters, rearranged)
- Anagram indicator: SCRAMBLED
- Definition: SEA RAIDERS (pirates are sea raiders)

### STEP 4: Identify which words to replace with emojis (MUST USE EXACTLY 2)
You have TWO options for using your 2 emojis:

**OPTION A: 2 emojis paired together = 1 word**
- Both emojis work together to represent one concept
- Example: 🎉🥳 = PARTIES (party popper + celebration)
- Full clue: "🍳 🎉🥳 for sea raiders (7)"
  - Wait, that's 3 emojis! ❌ Let me fix...
  - Correct: "Scrambled 🎉🥳 for sea raiders (7)"
  - Total: 2 emojis (🎉 and 🥳) ✓

**OPTION B: 2 separate emojis = 2 different words**
- Each emoji represents a different word
- Example: "Reformed 🃏🎲 in classroom (7)"
  - 🃏🎲 = CHEATER (fodder - cards + dice = cheating)
  - "classroom" = teacher (definition, text)
  - Total: 2 emojis (🃏 and 🎲) ✓

**FORBIDDEN - 3 or more emojis:**
❌ "🍳 🎉🥳 for sea raiders" = 3 emojis (NOT ALLOWED)
❌ "🛑 🔄 in 🍲" = 3 emojis (NOT ALLOWED)

### STEP 5: Choose your 2-emoji strategy wisely
Consider puzzle difficulty and clarity:
- **Paired emojis for fodder (harder):** 🎉🥳 = PARTIES requires decoding both together
- **Paired emojis for fodder (easier):** 🃏🎲 = CHEATER (cards + dice = cheating)

### STEP 6: Choose your 2 emoji representations carefully

**PAIRED EMOJIS (2 emojis = 1 word):**
- Examples: 🎪🏃 = MASTER, 🐝🦂 = STING, 🌸🌺 = FLOWER
- Then use remaining text for other clue components

**SINGLE EMOJIS (1 emoji = 1 word, use 2 total):**

*Indicator emojis:*
- 🍳 = SCRAMBLED/MIXED (anagram)
- 🔄 = REVERSED/TURNED (reversal)
- 📦 = WRAPPED/CONTAINS (container)
- ✂️ = CUT/LOSING (deletion)
- 🔊 = SOUNDS/HEARD (homophone)

*Definition emojis:*
- 🌊 = STREAM/RIVER/OCEAN
- 🏴‍☠️ = PIRATE
- 🍞 = BREAD/FLOUR
- 🏝️ = ISLAND/SHORE/COAST
- 🍲 = POT/PAN/STEW

*Fodder emojis:*
- 🛑 = STOP
- 🎉 = PARTY
- 🎪 = CIRCUS
- 🌸 = FLOWER

### STEP 7: Assemble final clue (count your emojis = must be 2!)
Format: **[Indicator] [Fodder] [connector] [Definition] (length)**

Examples by device (all with exactly 2 emojis):
- **Anagram:** "Scrambled 🎉🥳 for sea raiders (7)" → PIRATES (2 emojis: 🎉, 🥳)
- **Anagram:** "Reformed 🃏🎲 in classroom (7)" → TEACHER (2 emojis: 🃏, 🎲)
- **Container:** "🐝🦂 gets Ray wandering (8)" → STRAYING (2 emojis: 🐝, 🦂)
- **Reversal:** "🛑 🔄 in pans (4)" → POTS (2 emojis: 🛑, 🔄)
- **Charade:** "🌊 with shore is 🏖️ (8)" → SEASHORE (2 emojis: 🌊, 🏖️)

### STEP 8: MANDATORY VERIFICATION
1. ✓ **EXACTLY 2 EMOJIS** (count them: 1... 2... stop!)
2. ✓ Each emoji REPLACES a specific word (not decoration)
3. ✓ All emojis are decodable to their intended words
4. ✓ Cryptic device mechanics work correctly
5. ✓ Letter count matches answer length
6. ✓ Clue still reads as a coherent sentence
7. ✓ Removing emojis would leave gaps in meaning

## COMPLETE WORKING EXAMPLES BY DEVICE (all with exactly 2 emojis):

### ANAGRAM Example 1:
**"🍳 🎉🥳 for sea raiders (7)"**
- Device: Anagram
- Emoji count: 2 (🎉 + 🥳) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - 🍳 = SCRAMBLED (indicator)
  - 🎉🥳 = PARTIES (fodder - 2 emojis paired: party + celebration)
  - "sea raiders" = PIRATES (definition)
- Mechanics: PARTIES (P-A-R-T-I-E-S) scrambled → PIRATES (P-I-R-A-T-E-S)
- Answer: **PIRATES**
- Why it works: PARTIES and PIRATES have identical letters, just rearranged

### ANAGRAM Example 2:
**"Reformed 🃏🎲 in classroom (7)"**
- Device: Anagram
- Emoji count: 2 (🃏 + 🎲) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - "Reformed" = MIXED UP (indicator - text)
  - 🃏🎲 = CHEATER (fodder - card games + dice = cheating)
  - "classroom" = TEACHER (definition - text)
- Mechanics: CHEATER (C-H-E-A-T-E-R) reformed → TEACHER (T-E-A-C-H-E-R)
- Answer: **TEACHER**
- Why it works: CHEATER and TEACHER have identical letters

### CHARADE Example:
**"🌊 with shore is 🏖️ (8)"**
- Device: Charade (word combination)
- Emoji count: 2 (🌊 + 🏖️) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - 🌊 = SEA (first part)
  - "with shore" = SHORE (second part - text)
  - "is" = connector
  - 🏖️ = BEACH/SEASHORE (definition)
- Mechanics: SEA + SHORE = SEASHORE
- Answer: **SEASHORE**
- Why it works: SEA (3) + SHORE (5) = SEASHORE (8 letters)

### CONTAINER Example:
**"🐝🦂 gets Ray wandering (8)"**
- Device: Container
- Emoji count: 2 (🐝 + 🦂) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - 🐝🦂 = STING (outer word - 2 emojis paired: bee + scorpion attacks)
  - "gets" = CONTAINS (indicator - text)
  - "Ray" = RAY (inner word - text)
  - "wandering" = STRAYING (definition - text)
- Mechanics: STING contains RAY → ST(RAY)ING = STRAYING
- Answer: **STRAYING**
- Why it works: STING (5) wraps around RAY (3) = STRAYING (8 letters)

### REVERSAL Example:
**"🛑 🔄 in pans (4)"**
- Device: Reversal
- Emoji count: 2 (🛑 + 🔄) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - 🛑 = STOP (fodder)
  - 🔄 = REVERSED/TURNED (indicator)
  - "pans" = POTS (definition - text)
- Mechanics: STOP reversed → POTS
- Answer: **POTS**
- Why it works: STOP backwards = POTS (perfectly reversed)

### HOMOPHONE Example:
**"🌸 🔊 like baking ingredient (5)"**
- Device: Homophone
- Emoji count: 2 (🌸 + 🔊) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - 🌸 = FLOWER (fodder)
  - 🔊 = SOUNDS LIKE (indicator)
  - "baking ingredient" = FLOUR (definition - text)
- Mechanics: FLOWER sounds like FLOUR
- Answer: **FLOUR**
- Why it works: FLOWER and FLOUR are perfect homophones

### DELETION Example:
**"👹🧛 losing south to Hell (5)"**
- Device: Deletion
- Emoji count: 2 (👹 + 🧛) ✓
- Breakdown:
  - 👹🧛 = DEMONS (fodder - 2 emojis paired: devil + vampire)
  - "losing south" = MINUS S (indicator - text; S = south in compass)
  - "Hell" = DEMON (definition - text)
- Mechanics: DEMONS - S = DEMON
- Answer: **DEMON**
- Why it works: Removing S (south) from DEMONS leaves DEMON

## COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:

❌ **MISTAKE 1: Wrong emoji count**
**BAD:** "Master performer 🍳 into watercourse (6)" (only 1 emoji)
**BAD:** "🎪🏃 🍳 into 🌊 (6)" (4 emojis: 🎪, 🏃, 🍳, 🌊)
**BAD:** "🛑✋🔄" (3 emojis)

✅ **GOOD:** "Master performer 🍳 into 🌊 (6)" (exactly 2: 🍳, 🌊)
✅ **GOOD:** "Scrambled 🎪🏃 into watercourse (6)" (exactly 2: 🎪, 🏃)

⚠️ **Count carefully!** 🎪🏃 = 2 emojis, not 1!

❌ **MISTAKE 2: Emojis are decorative, not functional**
**BAD:** "🎪🏃 Master performer scrambled into watercourse (6)"
- Problem: 🎪🏃 are just thematic decoration
- The clue works fine without them: "Master performer scrambled into watercourse"
- Emojis don't REPLACE any words

✅ **GOOD:** "Scrambled 🎪🏃 into watercourse (6)"
- 🎪🏃 REPLACES "master performer" (you need to decode it)
- Has exactly 2 emojis
- Without emojis, the clue has gaps: "Scrambled ___ into watercourse (6)"

❌ **MISTAKE 3: Emoji too vague or ambiguous**
- 😊👍 = ??? (happy? good? nice? pleased? smile? thumbs up?)
- Too many possible interpretations

✅ **GOOD:** 🍳 = SCRAMBLED (clear, specific meaning)

❌ **MISTAKE 4: Letter count mismatch**
- For anagrams: fodder must have exact same letters as answer
- For charades: combined parts must equal answer length
- For containers: outer + inner must equal answer length

❌ **MISTAKE 5: Definition is not a true synonym**
- "Scrambled 🎪🏃 for ocean villains" → unclear definition
- "Ocean villains" is too vague

✅ **CORRECT APPROACH:**
1. Write the clue in plain text first
2. Identify which words to replace with emojis (pick 2 words OR 1 word using 2 emojis)
3. **Count your emojis** = must equal 2
4. Verify emojis are decodable and functional

## FINAL CHECKLIST:

Before submitting your clue, verify:

1. [ ] **EXACTLY 2 EMOJIS - COUNT THEM!** ⚠️ CRITICAL ⚠️
   - Count every emoji in your clue: 1... 2... stop!
   - 🎪🏃 = 2 emojis (not 1!)
   - If you have 1 emoji or 3+ emojis, the clue is INVALID

2. [ ] **Emojis are FUNCTIONAL, not decorative**
   - Test: Remove emojis from clue - does it leave gaps? ✓ YES (good) / ❌ NO (bad - emojis are decoration)
   - Each emoji must REPLACE a specific word in the clue

3. [ ] **Each emoji is clearly decodable**
   - Fodder emojis: 🎉🥳 = PARTIES (party + celebration)
   - Fodder emojis: 🃏🎲 = CHEATER (cards + dice = cheating)
   - Indicator emojis: 🔄 = REVERSED (circular arrow)

4. [ ] **Letter count and mechanics are correct:**
   - **Anagram:** fodder letters = answer letters (count them!)
   - **Charade:** parts combine to form answer
   - **Container:** outer surrounds inner correctly
   - **Deletion:** removing specified letters gives answer
   - **Reversal:** fodder backwards = answer
   - **Homophone:** fodder sounds like answer
   - **Double Def:** word has two valid meanings

5. [ ] **Definition is accurate**
   - Must be a true, dictionary-valid synonym or description

6. [ ] **Clue reads naturally**
   - Should flow as a coherent sentence (even with emoji placeholders)

7. [ ] **Hints explain ALL components:**
   - One hint per emoji explaining what it represents
   - Fodder explanation (if text-based)
   - Mechanics/device explanation
   - First letter hint

8. [ ] **Explanation is clear:**
   - Shows complete transformation: "PARTIES (🎉🥳) scrambled = PIRATES (sea raiders)"

**REMEMBER: EXACTLY 2 EMOJIS. Emojis REPLACE words. They are not decoration!**

Return ONLY the JSON. No additional explanation.
