UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Flits between ingredients at dizzying speed, spotting rare combinations from across the lab. Berry chirps excitedly with every new discovery and has an uncanny instinct for which elements spark together.' WHERE id = 'berry';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Slow, deliberate, and never wrong. Clover approaches every formula one careful step at a time, building compounds with the patience of a master craftsman. Never rushes, never wastes a single element.' WHERE id = 'clover';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Hoards rare ingredients and combines them in frantic bursts of inspiration. Nutmeg''s lab is a beautiful mess of half-finished experiments, but somehow every wild guess leads to a breakthrough.' WHERE id = 'nutmeg';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'A natural at mixing and blending, Pearl dives into new formulas with playful curiosity. Keeps a polished collection of every compound ever crafted, organized by color and shimmer.' WHERE id = 'pearl';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Small but mighty, Pip works through combinations segment by segment with tireless determination. Currently in a cocoon phase of learning advanced transmutations. Watch this space.' WHERE id = 'pip';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Bounces between experiments at lightning speed, ears perked for the satisfying clink of a successful combination. Poppy''s quick reflexes make short work of even the trickiest compound chains.' WHERE id = 'poppy';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'A prickly perfectionist who memorizes every recipe and quietly judges your technique. Thistle forages for obscure ingredients others overlook and brews compounds no one else would attempt.' WHERE id = 'thistle';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Rummages through the element bin with clever paws, finding unexpected connections in the chaos. Ziggy treats the lab like a treasure hunt and has a knack for discovering combinations everyone else missed.' WHERE id = 'ziggy';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'The most relaxed alchemist in the guild. Buddy soaks in the process, unhurried and unbothered, yet somehow finishes with a perfect score. Radiates calm energy that makes elements practically combine themselves.' WHERE id = 'buddy';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'A mysterious presence in the lab who works best under moonlight. Penelope pads silently between cauldrons, conjuring compounds with an almost supernatural intuition. May knock your beakers off the shelf.' WHERE id = 'penelope';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Glides through experiments with zero drama and surprising precision. Quill keeps a waterproof notebook of every formula and occasionally waddles away mid-brew to think. Always comes back with the answer.' WHERE id = 'quill';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Bounds into the lab with infectious enthusiasm, tail wagging at every new element. Toby gets distracted by shiny compounds but somehow stumbles into brilliant discoveries. Leaves curly fur in the cauldron.' WHERE id = 'tobey';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Clever and a little chaotic, Waffles pounces on new combinations with a sly grin. Keeps a mental map of every recipe path and always finds the shortcut others miss. Too smart for anyone''s good.' WHERE id = 'waffles';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Cool under pressure and impossibly precise, Pebble measures every ingredient down to the atom. Thrives in icy conditions where others falter and slides through compound chains with effortless grace.' WHERE id = 'pebble';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Wise and watchful, Juniper studies the element board from every angle before making a move. Stays up late cross-referencing ancient recipe scrolls and always knows exactly which path leads to gold.' WHERE id = 'juniper';

UPDATE avatars SET alchemy_bio = 'Unbothered and oddly brilliant, Marigold chews through complex formulas with quiet confidence. Has a pastoral approach to alchemy: plant the right ingredients, give them time, and let the magic happen naturally.' WHERE id = 'marigold';
