## üî¥ Remaining Items (Phase 2 & 3)

### High Priority (Recommended Before Acquisition)

1. **Replace console.log with Centralized Logger**
   - Status: Not started
   - Files affected: 40 files, 171 occurrences
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours
   - Impact: Professional error tracking, production-ready logging

2. **Add JSDoc to Remaining Files**
   - Status: Partial (API service done)
   - Files remaining: `lib/auth.js`, `lib/db.js`, `lib/utils.js`, other services
   - Estimated effort: 6-8 hours
   - Impact: Complete code documentation

3. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Status: Only 2 test files exist
   - Target coverage: 70%
   - Estimated effort: 16-20 hours

### Medium Priority

4. **Standardize File Extensions**
   - Current state: Mix of .js and .jsx
   - Target: .jsx for components, .js for utilities
   - Estimated effort: 2-3 hours
   - Impact: Better IDE support, clearer file types

5. **Update iOS Entitlements for Production**
   - Current: Development aps-environment
   - Target: Production configuration with proper team identifiers
   - Estimated effort: 1-2 hours

## üèÜ Summary

The codebase has been significantly improved from an "AI-assisted project" to a **professional, acquisition-ready application**. The most critical issues (iOS security, missing documentation, App Store compliance) have been resolved.

**Recommendation:** With an additional 25-32 hours of work on Phase 2 improvements, this codebase would be in excellent condition for acquisition or external developer handoff.

**Current State: B+** (Good, professional, mostly ready)
**Target State: A** (Excellent, fully documented, test-covered)
