## 2-LETTER WORD DATABASE

### Statistics
- **Total words:** 107 (complete official list)
- **Primary source:** Official Scrabble Players Dictionary 6th Edition (OSPD6)
- **Quality level:** Essential for crossword construction

### Why 2-Letter Words Are Essential

Two-letter words are **absolutely critical** for crossword construction because they:
1. Connect longer words in tight spaces
2. Enable complex grid patterns
3. Maximize grid flexibility
4. Allow for higher word counts in puzzles
5. Are fundamental building blocks that every constructor must know

Many crossword experts consider knowledge of 2-letter words MORE important than having an extensive vocabulary of longer words.

### Integration Recommendations

**For crossword generation software:**

1. **Load words by length** into separate data structures for fast lookup
2. **Index by letter patterns** (e.g., "_E_R_") for grid filling
3. **Score words** using the 1-100 frequency scale
4. **Set minimum thresholds:** Start with 50+ for clean fills, allow 40+ if needed
5. **Prioritize high-frequency words** in auto-fill algorithms
6. **Flag crosswordese** (score 20-40) to avoid overuse

**Pattern matching example:**
```
Query: "?E?R?" (5-letter word, E in position 2, R in position 4)
Results: BEARD, HEARD, LEARN, PEARL, TEARS, YEARS, etc.
```

**Frequency-weighted selection:**
- When multiple words fit a pattern, prioritize higher-scored words
- Balance grid quality (avoid multiple obscure words)
- Modern constructors aim for average word score of 50+

### Quality Control Guidelines

**DO include:**
✓ Everyday vocabulary recognizable to educated solvers
✓ Common proper nouns (major cities, countries, well-known people)
✓ Standard abbreviations (NASA, GPS, DVD)
✓ Contemporary terms (ADMIN, EMAIL, CYBER for 5-letter words)
✓ Varied letter patterns for grid flexibility

**AVOID:**
✗ Obscure crosswordese (ESNE, ERNE, ANOA)
✗ Excessive abbreviations
✗ Words requiring specialized knowledge
✗ Offensive or controversial terms
✗ Made-up or purely thematic words
✗ Nonsensical partials

### Scoring Reference Guide

Use this scale when implementing your database:

| Score | Description | Examples | Usage |
|-------|-------------|----------|-------|
| 90-100 | Ultra-common, everyday words | TO, THE, THAT, AREA, SAID | Use freely |
| 80-89 | Very common, interesting words | JAZZ, QUIZ, PHONE | Preferred |
| 70-79 | Common, solid vocabulary | FRAME, GLOVE, MAPLE | Standard fill |
| 60-69 | Acceptable, clear words | AGILE, BRISK, CHUNK | Good fill |
| 50-59 | Less common but fair | ABIDE, QUAFF, KNOLL | Acceptable |
| 40-49 | Use sparingly | Lesser-known but valid | Last resort |
| Below 40 | Avoid in quality puzzles | Crosswordese, obscurities | Avoid |

## SUMMARY & BEST PRACTICES

### Core Recommendations

**For a practical crossword generator database:**

1. **Start with these exact word counts:**
   - 2-letter: 107 words (complete official list) = 107 entries
   - 3-letter: ~400 common words + 150 abbreviations = 550 entries
   - 4-letter: ~1,000 common words + 100 abbreviations = 1,100 entries
   - 5-letter: 2,315 words (Wordle answer list) = 2,315 entries
   - **Total: ~4,072 high-quality entries**

2. **2-letter words are CRITICAL** - master these first, as they're essential for grid construction

3. **Use the Wordle answer list as your 5-letter foundation** - it's already perfectly curated for Wordle-style difficulty

4. **Implement word scoring** (1-100 scale) to prioritize common words in grid filling

5. **Structure by length** for efficient pattern matching and lookup

6. **American English spelling throughout** (FAVOR not FAVOUR, COLOR not COLOUR)

7. **Include common abbreviations** but avoid obscure ones

8. **Regular updates:** Add contemporary terms quarterly, remove dated references
