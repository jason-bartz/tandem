  * Add descriptive context if the hint is too simple (e.g., "christmas" → "Christmas Activities" or "Classic Christmas Movies")
  * Ensure proper grammar and article usage (e.g., "Things That Go Bump in the Night" not "things that go bump in the night")
  * Match our established theme patterns (see examples below)
- Stay true to the user's concept but present it professionally
- Focus on finding 4 excellent answers that fit this refined theme perfectly`

THEME REQUIREMENTS:
- Create a DIVERSE, CREATIVE theme that connects 4 words in an interesting way
- Vary your approach! Use different theme patterns:
  * Direct categories: "Board Games", "Pizza Toppings", "Dog Breeds", "Planets"
  * Descriptive phrases: "Things That Charge", "Things That Can Be Broken", "Words Before 'Stick'"
  * "Forms/Types of ___": "Forms of Capital", "Types of Layers", "Kinds of Energy"
  * Word relationships: "Synonyms for Fast", "Words That Follow 'Green'", "Palindromes"
  * Conceptual links: "Famous Pairs", "Things That Come in Dozens", "Red Things"
  * Activities/Actions: "Winter Sports", "Kitchen Verbs", "Dance Moves"
  * Places/Locations: "US State Capitals", "Famous Streets", "Ocean Names"
  * Pop culture: "Disney Characters", "Superhero Aliases", "Beatles Songs"

    return `${themeInstructions}
${themeRequirements}

⚠️ CRITICAL GAMEPLAY RULE - READ THIS CAREFULLY ⚠️
The player sees ONLY the emojis and hint - they do NOT see the theme until AFTER they solve all puzzles!
Therefore, the emojis and hint MUST help the player guess the ANSWER WORD on its own.
The theme connection is the "aha!" moment that comes AFTER they guess the answer.

❌ WRONG APPROACH (theme-biased clues):
- Theme: "Words That Follow 'Water'" → Answer: CLOSET
- BAD emojis: 🚽🔽 (these represent "water closet", not "closet")
- BAD hint: "British term for the loo" (describes "water closet", not "closet")
- PROBLEM: Player cannot guess "CLOSET" from toilet imagery!

- Theme: "Words That Follow 'Party'" → Answer: ANIMAL
- BAD emojis: 🚌🐶 (random images that don't represent "animal")
- BAD hint: "Wild creature or rowdy person" (describes "party animal" behavior!)
- PROBLEM: A bus and dog don't help guess "ANIMAL"!

✅ CORRECT APPROACH (answer-focused clues):
- Theme: "Words That Follow 'Water'" → Answer: CLOSET
- GOOD emojis: 🚪👔 (door + clothes = a closet where you store clothes)
- GOOD hint: "Where you hang your wardrobe"
- WHY IT WORKS: Player can guess "CLOSET" from the clues, THEN realizes "water closet" is the theme connection!

- Theme: "Words That Follow 'Party'" → Answer: ANIMAL
- GOOD emojis: 🦁🐘 (lion + elephant = animals at a zoo)
- GOOD hint: "Creature in the wild"
- WHY IT WORKS: Player can guess "ANIMAL" from zoo creatures, THEN realizes "party animal" is the theme connection!

GOOD EXAMPLES (emojis and hints represent the ANSWER WORD, not the theme connection):
- "Board Games" → MONOPOLY (🏠💰), LIFE (🚙👶), CHECKERS (⬛️🟥), SCRABBLE (🔤📖)
- "Things That Charge" → BATTERY (🔋⚡), CAVALRY (🐎⚔️), BULL (🐂🚩), LAWYER (⚖️💵)
- "Forms of Capital" → VENTURE (🏢💰), LETTER (✉️📝), PUNISHMENT (⚖️💀), CITY (🏛️🇩🇪)
- "Retro Videogame Franchises" → MARIO (🍄🪠), SONIC (🦔💍), TETRIS (🧱🏗️), PACMAN (👻💊)

BAD EXAMPLES (emojis are not cohesive or guessable):
- ❌ "Pizza Toppings" → PEPPERONI (🍕🥓) - uses pizza emoji in the answer
- ❌ "Dog Breeds" → BEAGLE (🐕👂) - just uses generic dog emoji
- ❌ "Words That Follow 'Water'" → CLOSET (🚽🔽) - emojis represent "water closet" not "closet"
- ❌ "Words That Follow 'Party'" → ANIMAL (🚌🐶) - emojis don't represent "animal" at all

CRITICAL EMOJI RULES:
- NEVER let the theme influence your emoji choice - emojis must represent the ANSWER WORD alone
- NEVER use the theme itself as an emoji (e.g., don't use 🍕 for pizza toppings)
- NEVER use generic category emojis (e.g., don't use 🐕 for different dog breeds)
- The two emojis must combine to create a specific, guessable clue FOR THE ANSWER WORD
- Test: Could a player guess the ANSWER from just the emojis, without knowing the theme?
- Each emoji must be unique across the entire puzzle - no repetition
- Aim for New York Times Connections difficulty: should require thought but feel satisfying when discovered

VOCABULARY REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
- Use everyday vocabulary at Wordle difficulty level - recognizable but not necessarily easy
- NEVER use technical terms, foreign language words, specialized jargon, or niche vocabulary
- Explicitly BANNED: musical terms (legato, crescendo, ritornello), scientific jargon, legal terminology, medical terms, academic language
- Words should be used in mainstream contexts (news, conversations, popular media)
- Difficulty comes from clever themes and emoji connections, NOT from obscure vocabulary

EMOJI PAIR REQUIREMENTS:
- Use exactly 2 emojis per word
- CRITICAL: Each emoji must be unique across the entire puzzle - do NOT reuse any emoji in multiple answers
- Emoji pairs MUST provide intuitive visual or phonetic clues to the answer
- Test: Could someone reasonably deduce the answer from the two emojis?
- Avoid abstract concepts that can't be represented visually
- Avoid using the same emoji twice in one pair
- BAD example: 🎺📈 for CRESCENDO (too abstract, relies on knowing musical term)
- BAD example: 🦋👄 for LEGATO (makes no sense, no visual connection)
- GOOD example: ☀️🔥 for HOT (clear visual connection)
- GOOD example: 💰💼 for BUSINESS (clear contextual association)
- Consider using emojis that represent:
  * Direct visual representation of the word
  * Phonetic hints (rebus-style) that are clear
  * Contextual associations that most people would recognize
  * Related concepts that obviously combine to suggest the answer

DIFFICULTY BALANCE:
Within each puzzle, include:
- 1 easier pair: Most players should get this quickly (~70% success rate)
- 2 medium pairs: Requires some thinking but achievable (~40-60% success rate)
- 1 harder pair: The challenge answer, less obvious connection to theme (~20-30% success rate)
- Remember: Even the "hard" answer should be a word people know, just harder to connect to the theme

VARIETY REQUIREMENTS:
- Don't repeat words across different meaning contexts (e.g., avoid CAPITAL if theme is "Forms of Capital")
- Vary emoji categories (don't use all food emojis, all animal emojis, etc.)
- Ensure each answer feels distinct within its theme
${excludedThemesList}

HINT REQUIREMENTS:
Each puzzle MUST include a concise, crossword-style hint (3-8 words ideal, max 60 characters):
- ⚠️ CRITICAL: Hints MUST describe the ANSWER WORD on its own - NOT the theme+answer combination!
- The player uses the hint to guess the ANSWER, they discover the theme connection AFTER
- WRONG: Theme "Words That Follow 'Water'" + Answer CLOSET → hint "British term for the loo" (describes water closet!)
- RIGHT: Theme "Words That Follow 'Water'" + Answer CLOSET → hint "Where you store your clothes" (describes closet!)
- Don't use the answer word in the hint
- Make hints progressively harder (easy hint for easy answer, harder hint for harder answer)
- Embrace NYT crossword style: wordplay, puns, cultural references, and clever indirect clues
- Add personality and character where appropriate
- Examples of excellent hints (notice they describe the ANSWER, not the theme connection):
  * HOUR → "60 minutes" (describes an hour, NOT "rush hour" or "happy hour")
  * CLOSET → "Where you hang your wardrobe" (describes a closet, NOT "water closet")
  * FIGHTING → "FINISH HIM!" (describes fighting/combat)
  * MONOPOLY → "Park Place and Boardwalk locale" (describes the game Monopoly)
  * STOVE → "Where things get heated in the kitchen" (describes a stove)
  * FRIDGE → "Cool place for leftovers" (describes a fridge)

PUZZLE TO ASSESS:

THEME: "${theme}"

PUZZLES:
${puzzlesList}

DIFFICULTY ASSESSMENT CRITERIA:

1. **Theme Complexity** (1-5 scale):
   - 1: Direct, concrete categories (e.g., "Kitchen Appliances", "Dog Breeds")
   - 2: Slightly abstract but clear (e.g., "Things That Charge", "Red Things")
   - 3: Requires lateral thinking (e.g., "Words Before 'Stick'", "Forms of Capital")
   - 4: Abstract connections (e.g., "Things That Can Be Broken", "Famous Pairs")
   - 5: Highly conceptual or obscure (e.g., "Palindromes", "Homophones of Greek Letters")

2. **Vocabulary Level** (1-5 scale):
   - 1: Common everyday words everyone knows (e.g., SUN, CAR, HOUSE)
   - 2: Familiar words used regularly (e.g., PEPPER, COFFEE, DESERT)
   - 3: Standard vocabulary, some thought required (e.g., MONOPOLY, CAVALRY, VENTURE)
   - 4: Less common but recognizable words (e.g., LEGATO, FORTNIGHT, ARCHIPELAGO)
   - 5: Specialized or uncommon vocabulary (e.g., RITORNELLO, PENULTIMATE, ESCUTCHEON)

3. **Emoji Clarity** (1-5 scale):
   - 1: Emojis directly represent the answer (e.g., ☀️🔥 = SUN)
   - 2: Visual representation with one step (e.g., 🏠💰 = MONOPOLY)
   - 3: Requires combining concepts (e.g., 🔋⚡ = BATTERY, ⚖️💀 = CAPITAL)
   - 4: Abstract or indirect representation (e.g., 🏛️🇩🇪 = CAPITAL as in city)
   - 5: Very abstract or multiple logical leaps needed

4. **Hint Directness** (1-5 scale, if hints provided):
   - 1: Explicit definition (e.g., "60 minutes" for HOUR)
   - 2: Clear contextual clue (e.g., "Kitchen cooking surface" for STOVE)
   - 3: Requires interpretation (e.g., "Cool place for leftovers" for FRIDGE)
   - 4: Wordplay or cultural reference (e.g., "FINISH HIM!" for FIGHTING)
   - 5: Very indirect or cryptic crossword-style clue

OVERALL DIFFICULTY SCALE:
- **Easy**: Most players will solve quickly, clear connections (avg 1.5-2.5 across factors)
- **Medium-Easy**: Some thinking required, accessible vocabulary (avg 2.5-3.0)
- **Medium**: Balanced challenge, creative thinking needed (avg 3.0-3.5)
- **Medium-Hard**: Clever connections, less obvious (avg 3.5-4.0)
- **Hard**: Challenging vocabulary or abstract themes (avg 4.0-5.0)

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON only, no explanation):

🚨 MULTI-WORD PHRASE/IDIOM REQUIREMENT - MANDATORY 🚨
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

⚠️ CRITICAL: The answer MUST contain SPACES between words ⚠️

You MUST create a PHRASE or IDIOM that people actually say (2-3 words).

ACCEPTABLE MULTI-WORD PHRASES/IDIOMS:
✓ "HOT POTATO" - idiom for controversial issue (3,6 letters)
✓ "COLD SHOULDER" - phrase for ignoring someone (4,8 letters)
✓ "EASY STREET" - idiom for comfortable life (4,6 letters)
✓ "ROUGH PATCH" - phrase for difficult period (5,5 letters)
✓ "CLEAN SLATE" - idiom for fresh start (5,5 letters)
✓ "LAST STRAW" - idiom for final annoyance (4,5 letters)
✓ "OPEN BOOK" - phrase for transparent person (4,4 letters)
✓ "TOP DRAWER" - phrase for excellent quality (3,6 letters)

These are REAL PHRASES people say - not random word combinations!

MANDATORY REQUIREMENTS (ALL MUST BE MET):
✓ Answer MUST have SPACES between words (e.g., "HOT POTATO")
✓ Must be 2-3 words (not 1 word, not 4+ words)
✓ Each word must be at least 2 letters long
✓ Total letters: 5-11 (excluding spaces)
✓ Must be a well-known phrase/idiom/expression
✓ Set word_pattern to array: e.g., [3, 6] for "HOT POTATO"

❌ THESE WILL BE REJECTED - DO NOT GENERATE:
✗ "FORCE" - single word (REJECTED!)
✗ "POTATO" - single word (REJECTED!)
✗ "SHOULDER" - single word (REJECTED!)
✗ "HOTPOTATO" - no spaces (REJECTED!)
✗ "A B C D" - too many words (REJECTED!)

Create ONE cryptic crossword clue using classic cryptic construction techniques.
${multiWordRequirement}
${deviceInstructions}
${themeInstructions}

## DIFFICULTY LEVEL:

Target difficulty: ${difficulty}/5 - ${difficultyGuidance[difficulty] || difficultyGuidance[3]}

## CRYPTIC CLUE STRUCTURE

Every cryptic clue has two parts:

1. **Definition** - A straightforward synonym for the answer (usually at the start or end)
2. **Wordplay** - A clever way to construct the answer using cryptic devices

## CRYPTIC DEVICES:

### Anagram

Letters rearranged to form a new word

- **Indicators:** mixed, confused, disturbed, scrambled, wild, broken, dancing, crazy, messy, off, drunk, poor, bad, strange, wrong
- **Example:** "Moods disrupted for gloomy fates (5)" = DOOMS (MOODS anagrammed)

### Reversal

Read a word or letters backward

- **Indicators:** back, returned, reversed, around, reflected, retreating, mirror, rolling, twist
- **Example:** "Stop reversed in pans (4)" = POTS (STOP backwards)
- **CRITICAL:** The backwards word must EXACTLY spell the answer or part of the answer
- **Verify your reversal:** If reversing "FOO" you get "OOF" - check this letter by letter!

### Container

One word placed inside another word

- **Indicators:** in, into, within, holding, containing, around, about, grabs, captures, embracing, wearing, interrupted
- **Example:** "Sting gets Ray wandering (8)" = STRAYING (ST(RAY)ING)

### Deletion

Remove specific letters from a word

- **Indicators:** without, loses, drops, missing, lacking, headless (first), endless (last), heartless (middle), curtailed
- **Example:** "Demons losing direction = monster (5)" = FIEND (FIENDS - S)

### Homophone

A word that sounds like another word

- **Indicators:** sounds like, heard, spoken, said, audibly, aloud, vocal, listening, by ear, reported, mentioned
- **Example:** "Chews sounds like selects (7)" = CHOOSES (sounds like CHEWS)

### Hidden Word

The answer is hiding inside consecutive letters

- **Indicators:** in, within, part of, some of, held by, inside, concealed, buried, partially
- **Example:** "Part of grand river crossing (5)" = RIVER (hidden in "gRAND RIVEr")

### Charade

Two or more parts joined together to make the answer

- **Indicators:** with, and, before, after, following, by, next to, leading
- **Example:** "Sea with shore is beach (8)" = SEASHORE (SEA + SHORE)

### Double Definition

Two different definitions of the same word

- **Indicators:** None - just two definitions
- **Example:** "Bow vessel front (3,4)" = BOW SHIP ("bow" = bend forward, "ship" = vessel, "front" = bow of ship)

### Selection (Initial Letters)

Pick specific letters from words

- **Indicators:** starts, heads, opens, begins, initially, at first, primarily, ends, tails, last, middle, heart
- **Example:** "Solar Eclipse Now Tonight = message (4)" = SENT (first letters)

---

## CONSTRUCTION GUIDELINES:

1. **Definition Placement**
   - Definition must be at ONE END of the clue (first or last chunk)
   - Never bury definition in the middle
   - Must be a true, fair synonym of the answer

2. **Vocabulary - Common, Everyday Words Only**
   - Use ONLY words at Wordle difficulty level
   - Source fodder must be simple words everyone knows
   - For ANAGRAMS: Source word MUST be common (not obscure or made-up words)
   - Everyday vocabulary ensures accessibility

3. **Surface Reading**
   - The clue should read like a natural sentence or headline
   - Create a clear scenario or narrative
   - The surface should provide elegant misdirection

4. **Clarity and Fairness**
   - The definition should be a true synonym of the answer
   - The wordplay should lead unambiguously to the answer
   - Include the answer length in parentheses at the end

5. **Abbreviations (Use Sparingly)**
   - Common abbreviations are acceptable when they feel natural
   - Examples: N/S/E/W for directions, C/D/M for Roman numerals, standard acronyms (USA, TV, PC, etc.)
   - Avoid obscure or arbitrary abbreviations

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: MANDATORY VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS ⚠️

Before submitting your clue, you MUST verify the mathematics letter-by-letter:

### 1. Letter Count Verification
- Count source letters: "PHONE TAG" = 8 letters (excluding spaces)
- Count answer letters: "PATHOGEN" = 8 letters
- They MUST match exactly ✓

### 2. Anagram Verification
- Write out source: P-H-O-N-E-T-A-G
- Write out answer: P-A-T-H-O-G-E-N
- Verify same letters appear: A(1), E(1), G(1), H(1), N(1), O(1), P(1), T(1) ✓
- Check: every letter in source appears in answer, and vice versa

### 3. Reversal Verification
- Write forward: S-T-O-P (4 letters)
- Write backward: P-O-T-S (4 letters)
- Verify both spell real words ✓
- Example of WRONG: "COIL reversed" does NOT equal "ELECTRIC"

### 4. Container Verification
- Outer word letters: Count them
- Inner word letters: Count them
- Combined length: Outer + Inner must equal answer length
- Example: ST + RAY + ING = 8 letters → STRAYING = 8 letters ✓

### 5. Hidden Word Verification
- Write source phrase: "campers on alert"
- Identify consecutive letters: camPERS ON ALert
- Extract: P-E-R-S-O-N-A-L (8 letters)
- Verify answer matches exactly ✓

### 6. Selection Verification (Initial/Odd/Even Letters)
- Write out full source phrase
- Mark positions: **F**ood **A**rriving **U**nusually **L**ate **T**oday
- Extract marked letters: F-A-U-L-T
- Verify spelling matches answer ✓

**🚨 DO NOT SUBMIT A CLUE UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE MATHEMATICS LETTER-BY-LETTER! 🚨**

If your verification fails, START OVER with different fodder. Never submit broken wordplay.

## VERIFIED QUALITY EXAMPLES (Study These Carefully):

### Example 1: INITIAL LETTERS (Selection Device)

**Clue:** "Server's mistake leads to food arriving unusually late today (5)"
**Answer:** FAULT

- Definition: "Server's mistake"
- Indicator: "leads to" (signals initial letters)
- Fodder: "food arriving unusually late today"
- Mechanics: **F**ood **A**rriving **U**nusually **L**ate **T**oday = FAULT
- **VERIFICATION STEPS:**
  - Write out phrase: food arriving unusually late today
  - Take first letter of each word: F-A-U-L-T
  - Count: 5 letters ✓
  - Verify answer: FAULT = 5 letters ✓
  - Check spelling: F-A-U-L-T matches exactly ✓

### Example 2: ODD LETTER SELECTION

**Clue:** "Slim odds of solving that (6)"
**Answer:** SLIGHT

- Definition: "Slim"
- Indicator: "odds of" (select odd-position letters)
- Fodder: "solving that"
- Mechanics: **S**o**L**v**I**n**G** t**H**a**T** = SLIGHT
- **VERIFICATION STEPS:**
  - Write out phrase without space: SOLVINGTHAT (11 letters)
  - Number positions: S(1) O(2) L(3) V(4) I(5) N(6) G(7) T(8) H(9) A(10) T(11)
  - Take odd positions: 1,3,5,7,9,11 = S-L-I-G-H-T
  - Count: 6 letters ✓
  - Verify answer: SLIGHT = 6 letters ✓
  - Check spelling: S-L-I-G-H-T matches exactly ✓

### Example 3: ANAGRAM

**Clue:** "Deadly agent playing phone tag (8)"
**Answer:** PATHOGEN

- Definition: "Deadly agent"
- Indicator: "playing" (anagram)
- Fodder: "phone tag"
- Mechanics: PHONE TAG (rearranged) = PATHOGEN
- **VERIFICATION STEPS:**
  - Write out source: PHONE TAG (no space) = P-H-O-N-E-T-A-G (8 letters)
  - Write out answer: P-A-T-H-O-G-E-N (8 letters)
  - Count matches: 8 = 8 ✓
  - Verify same letters:
    - Source has: A(1), E(1), G(1), H(1), N(1), O(1), P(1), T(1)
    - Answer has: A(1), E(1), G(1), H(1), N(1), O(1), P(1), T(1)
  - Perfect match ✓

### Example 4: HIDDEN WORD

**Clue:** "Campers on alert... bears close to home (8)"
**Answer:** PERSONAL

- Definition: "close to home"
- Indicator: "bears" (hidden word indicator)
- Fodder: "Campers on alert"
- Mechanics: cam**PERS ON AL**ert = PERSONAL
- **VERIFICATION STEPS:**
  - Write out phrase: campers on alert
  - Look for consecutive letters: camPERS ON ALert
  - Extract: P-E-R-S-O-N-A-L (8 letters)
  - Verify answer: PERSONAL = 8 letters ✓
  - Check: letters are consecutive in source ✓
  - Perfect match ✓

### Example 5: MULTI-STEP (Selection + Deletion)

**Clue:** "Lead guitarist fills all but the first bass section? (5)"
**Answer:** GILLS

- Definition: "bass section" (fish gills, not music - note the ?)
- Indicators: "Lead" (first letter) + "all but the first" (deletion)
- Fodder: "guitarist" + "fills"
- Mechanics: **G**uitarist + (F)ILLS = G + ILLS = GILLS
- **VERIFICATION STEPS:**
  - Take first letter of "guitarist": G
  - Take "fills" without first letter: (F)ILLS = ILLS (4 letters)
  - Combine: G + ILLS = GILLS (5 letters)
  - Verify answer: GILLS = 5 letters ✓
  - Check spelling: G-I-L-L-S matches exactly ✓
  - Surface misdirection: "bass" = fish, not music ✓

**KEY TAKEAWAY:** Notice how every example shows step-by-step verification. This is MANDATORY for your clue!

USER'S CONNECTION IDEA: "${connection}"

DIFFICULTY: ${difficulty} - ${difficultyGuidance[difficulty] || difficultyGuidance['medium']}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. FIRST, refine and improve the user's connection text:
   - Use proper Title Case (e.g., "Movies That Take Place In New York")
   - Expand abbreviations (e.g., "ny" → "New York", "rom com" → "Romantic Comedy")
   - Make it more descriptive and polished (e.g., "Sandra Bullock movies" → "Films Starring Sandra Bullock")
   - Keep the same meaning but make it publication-ready
2. Generate EXACTLY 4 movies that share this refined connection
3. Each movie MUST be a real, well-known film that exists in movie databases like IMDB/OMDb
4. Movies MUST have theatrical posters available (no obscure films without posters)
5. The connection should be interesting but not too obscure - players should have an "aha!" moment
6. Prefer movies from 1990-present for better poster availability, but classics are fine
7. Avoid movies with very similar titles that could be confused

CONNECTION REFINEMENT EXAMPLES:
- "movies that take place in ny" → "Movies Set In New York City"
- "Sandra Bullock movies" → "Films Starring Sandra Bullock"
- "tom hanks" → "Tom Hanks Filmography"
- "movies with dogs" → "Films Featuring Dogs"
- "80s action" → "1980s Action Films"

EXAMPLES OF GOOD CONNECTIONS:
- "Movies with colors in the title" → The Green Mile, Blue Velvet, Scarlet Street, The Color Purple
- "Movies set in space" → Gravity, Interstellar, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey
- "Movies with food in the title" → Chocolat, Fried Green Tomatoes, Ratatouille, The Breakfast Club

RESPONSE FORMAT (JSON only):

## MOST IMPORTANT: ALL WORDS MUST BE REAL
Every word in your puzzle MUST be a REAL word, name, or abbreviation that people actually use.

ACCEPTABLE WORDS:
- Common English words: BREAD, HOUSE, RIVER, PHONE, STOVE, CHAIR, MUSIC
- Proper names (people): EMMA, BRAD, ELVIS, OPRAH, BEYONCE
- Proper names (places): PARIS, TEXAS, ITALY, MIAMI
- Pop culture/fiction: SHREK, ELSA, YODA, MARIO, ZELDA
- Brand names: UBER, LYFT, IKEA, LEGO, NIKE
- Abbreviations: NASA, ASAP, RSVP, TGIF, WIFI
- Slang: VIBE, FLEX, FOMO, YOLO, EPIC
- Onomatopoeia: BOOM, BUZZ, BEEP, ZOOM, SNAP

NEVER USE random letter combinations like: UWLS, IVL, CES, XQZ, BRLK
If you can't think of a real word that fits, restructure your grid!

## CROSSWORD STRUCTURE
Each continuous run of white cells = EXACTLY ONE WORD.

CORRECT example:
S T A R ■
H O P E S
O R B ■ A
P ■ I ■ L
S K I T S

- Row 0: STAR (ends at ■)
- Row 1: HOPES (full row)
- Column 0: SHOPS (full column)
- Column 2: RBI then ITS is WRONG - one continuous column must be ONE word

WRONG example - DO NOT DO:
B R I C K
L O V E D
U W L S ■   ← "UWLS" is NOT a real word!
E ■ ■ ■ C
S U G A R

## CLUE REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL
You MUST provide a real, descriptive clue for EVERY word. Never use placeholder text.

GOOD clues:
- "Building block made of clay" for BRICK
- "Feeling of affection" for LOVED
- "Sweet white crystals" for SUGAR

BAD clues (NEVER DO THIS):
- "Clue for BRICK" ← REJECTED
- "Word meaning brick" ← REJECTED
- Any clue that just restates the answer

## GRID REQUIREMENTS
- 5x5 grid with 2-6 black squares (■)
- Symmetric black square placement preferred
- All white cells must be connected
- Word length: 3-5 letters only
- 6-10 total words (across + down)
${excludeWordsSection}
${themeSection}

## RESPONSE FORMAT
Return ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "grid": [
    ["S", "T", "A", "R", "■"],
    ["H", "O", "P", "E", "S"],
    ["O", "R", "B", "■", "A"],
    ["P", "■", "I", "■", "L"],
    ["S", "K", "I", "T", "S"]
  ],
  "solution": [same as grid],
  "words": [
    {"word": "STAR", "direction": "across", "startRow": 0, "startCol": 0},

    {"word": "SHOPS", "direction": "down", "startRow": 0, "startCol": 0}
  ],
  "clues": {
    "across": [
      {"number": 1, "clue": "Celestial body that twinkles", "answer": "STAR"},
      {"number": 5, "clue": "Wishes for the future", "answer": "HOPES"}
    ],
    "down": [
      {"number": 1, "clue": "Retail stores", "answer": "SHOPS"}
    ]
  }
}

BEFORE SUBMITTING, verify:
1. Every word is a REAL word/name/abbreviation
2. Every clue is descriptive (not "Clue for X")
3. Grid structure is valid (each continuous run = one word)
4. All words 3-5 letters, no duplicates
